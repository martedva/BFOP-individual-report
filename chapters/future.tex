\textbf{Missing Workshop}
In the future I would like to make sure, that a workshop was conducted. Unfortunately, even though we had the workshop prepared, the company declined. A \textit{analysis-oriented workshop}\footnote{Bibtex PID, p. 211}, would have allowed us to reach a common understanding of work practices and issues related to this hereby ensuring a coherent vision through genuine user participation.

As we only conducted individual interviews, we lack this triangulation of information. A relevant activity at this workshop would be to make a joint diagnostic map in cooperation with the employees.
