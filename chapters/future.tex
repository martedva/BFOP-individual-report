\textbf{Missing Workshop}
In the future I would like to make sure, that a workshop is conducted. Unfortunately, even though we had the workshop prepared, the company declined. A \textit{analysis-oriented workshop}\footnote{\cite{boedker}, p. 211}, would have allowed us to reach a common understanding of work practices, and issues related to this, hereby ensuring a coherent vision through genuine user participation. 
\\\\
As we only conducted individual interviews, we lack this triangulation of information. Instead we had to objectively identify common problems and their severity through comparison of interviews. To compensate for our missing triangulation, our workflow diagram describing the acknowledged work processes in the Service department, the diagram was confirmed by Christian Ingemann, Head of Service\footnote{Reviewed at the meeting with the steering committee on the 3\textsuperscript{rd} of November. Resume can be seen in appendix \ref{meeting_3_11}.}.
\\\\
A relevant activity at this workshop would be to make a joint \textit{diagnostic map} in cooperation with the participants to create cohesion in the collected information\footnote{\cite{boedker}, p. 253} from the Service department.
\\
A \textit{dead sea scroll} could also be done by the participants to establish a joint understanding of the complex workflows\footnote{\cite{boedker}, p. 261} mapped in the workflow diagram our group created.
