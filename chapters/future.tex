\textbf{Missing Workshop}
In the future I would like to make sure, that a workshop is conducted. Unfortunately, even though we had the workshop prepared, the company declined. A \textit{analysis-oriented workshop}\footnote{Bibtex PID, p. 211}, would have allowed us to reach a common understanding of work practices, and issues related to this, hereby ensuring a coherent vision through genuine user participation.

As we only conducted individual interviews, we lack this triangulation of information. Instead we had to objectively identify common problems and their severity through comparison of interviews. A relevant activity at this workshop would be to make a joint diagnostic map in cooperation with the employees to obtain this information.
