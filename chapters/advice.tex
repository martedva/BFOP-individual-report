There is a good chance that the company will be very limited timewise. Therefore, following these three tips will ensure the best utilization of their time and fewer cancellations of meetings:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Contact Person} - agreeing on a designated contact person within the company will result in faster response time.
	\item \textit{Plan Early} - arrange meetings and activities as soon as possible and with as few restrictions as possible. This allows the company to plan the activity according to their schedule instead of yours.
	\item \textit{WIIFM}\footnote{Abbreviation for 'What is in it for me?'} - Remember to have clear, consice, and well-documented arguments for their participation in the given activity, allowing them to easily understand their gain.
\end{itemize}
Prioritization of the company is vital for the project as, insights, data, and feedback from the company ultimately defines your business case.
